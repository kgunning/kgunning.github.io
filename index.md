I've spent the last five years working on my PhD with the Stanford GPS Lab direction of Professor Todd Walter and Professor Per Enge.  My work has focused building high accuracy, high integrity navigation systems.  My PhD defense is this Friday, and I'm excited to share what I've been working on with all of you.
