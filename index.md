# Safety Critical Bounds for Precise Positioning of Aviation and Autonomy

![defense logo](\KGunning_600x258.png)

I've spent the last five years working on my PhD at the Stanford GPS Lab direction of Professor Todd Walter and Professor Per Enge.  My work has focused building high accuracy, high integrity navigation systems.  My PhD defense is this Friday, and I'm excited to share what I've been working on with all of you. 

## Details
Feel free to join the Zoom meeting a few minutes early to say hello and wish me luck. The defense will be about an hour with an opportunity for questions from the public at the end. The public session will then conclude, and a private session with only the professors on my defense committee will begin and last for approximately two hours.  

## Abstract
UAV and autonomous platforms can greatly benefit from an assured position solution with high integrity error bounds.  The expected high degree of connectivity in these vehicles will allow users to receive real time precise clock and ephemeris corrections, which enable the use of Precise Point Positioning techniques. Up to now, these techniques have mostly been used to provide high accuracy, rather than focusing on high integrity applications.  In this defense, I apply the methodology and algorithms used in aviation to determine position error bounds with high integrity (or protection levels) for a PPP position solution.
